# News Summary challenge

## Project overview
- This app grabs all the headlines from the Guardian newspaper API and displays them on a page.
- Clicking on a headline shows a summary of the article.

### Technologies
- This is a single page web app.
- The code is comprised of frontend JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
- No existing libraries or frameworks are used.

### Serving the app
A static web server ([http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) is used to serve HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. Requests are sent to an API to get data from the Guardian and to summarise text.
